/*Let's begin with the first question: 
 * 1. Describe the characteristics of abstract classes in Java. How do they differ from concrete classes, and what is the role of abstract methods within abstract classes?
 
Ans :  Abstract classes in Java are used as blueprints for creating other classes. They cannot be instantiated directly, meaning you cannot create objects of abstract classes. Abstract classes can have both abstract and non-abstract methods. The main characteristics of abstract classes are: 1. Abstract classes can have abstract methods, which are declared without an implementation and are meant to be overridden by the subclasses. 
2. Abstract classes can also have non-abstract methods, which have a complete implementation and can be inherited by the subclasses. 
3. Abstract classes can have instance variables, constructors, and static methods. 
4. Abstract classes can be extended by other classes using the "extends" keyword. Concrete classes, on the other hand, are regular classes that can be instantiated directly. They provide complete implementations for all their methods. The role of abstract methods within abstract classes is to define a contract or a set of methods that the subclasses must implement. These abstract methods act as placeholders, and the responsibility of providing the implementation lies with the subclasses.
 
 2. Explain the purpose of interfaces in Java and how they define contracts for implementing classes. Provide an example illustrating the use of interfaces to achieve code flexibility and multiple inheritance.
 
 Ans : Interfaces in Java are used to define a contract or a set of methods that a class must implement. They act as a blueprint for classes, specifying the methods that must be implemented without providing any implementation details. 
 The purpose of interfaces in Java includes: 
 1. Achieving abstraction: Interfaces allow us to achieve 100% abstraction by providing a way to define methods without any implementation. This allows for loose coupling and separation of concerns in the code. 
 2. Defining contracts: Interfaces define a contract that implementing classes must adhere to. Any class that implements an interface must provide an implementation for all the methods defined in the interface. 
 3. Enabling code flexibility: Interfaces provide a way to achieve code flexibility by allowing classes to implement multiple interfaces. This enables a class to inherit behavior from multiple sources, promoting code reuse and modularity. To illustrate the use of interfaces, 
 let's consider an example. 
 Suppose we have an interface called "Shape" with a method called "calculateArea()". Any class that implements the "Shape" interface must provide an implementation for the "calculateArea()" method. This allows us to have different classes, such as "Circle" and "Rectangle", each implementing the "Shape" interface and providing their own implementation for the "calculateArea()" method. By using interfaces, we can achieve code flexibility and multiple inheritance-like behavior, as a class can implement multiple interfaces and inherit behavior from all of them. 
 
 3. When we have the abstract class so it is also used for abstraction then why we are using the interfaces? What is the role of interfaces?
 
 Ans : While both abstract classes and interfaces can be used for achieving abstraction, they serve different purposes and have distinct roles in Java. Abstract classes are used when we want to create a common base class that provides some default implementation and can be extended by subclasses. They can have both abstract and non-abstract methods, and they allow for code reuse through inheritance. Abstract classes are useful when we want to define a common set of methods and attributes for a group of related classes. 
 
 On the other hand, interfaces are used to define a contract or a set of methods that a class must implement. They only contain method signatures without any implementation details. A class can implement multiple interfaces, allowing for code flexibility and achieving multiple inheritance-like behavior. Interfaces are useful when we want to define a behavior that can be implemented by different classes, regardless of their inheritance hierarchy. 
 
 The key differences between abstract classes and interfaces are:
  
 1. Abstract classes can have both abstract and non-abstract methods, while interfaces can only have abstract methods. 
 2. A class can extend only one abstract class, but it can implement multiple interfaces. 
 3. Abstract classes can have instance variables, constructors, and static methods, while interfaces can only have constant variables and method signatures. In summary, abstract classes are used when we want to provide a common base class with default implementation, while interfaces are used when we want to define a contract for implementing classes and achieve code flexibility through multiple inheritance-like behavior.
 

3. In a real-world scenario, explain when to use an abstract class versus an interface for designing class hierarchies. Provide examples where each approach is more suitable.
 
a real-world scenario to understand when to use an abstract class versus an interface for designing class hierarchies. Let's say we are designing a system for a university that offers different types of courses. We have a base class called "Course" that represents common attributes and behaviors of all courses. Now, we need to decide whether to use an abstract class or an interface for the class hierarchy. In this scenario, we can use an abstract class when: 
1. We want to provide a default implementation for common methods in the "Course" class, such as "getCourseName()" or "getCourseDuration()". 
2. We want to define common instance variables, such as "courseCode" or "instructorName", that are shared by all courses. 
3. We want to enforce certain methods to be implemented by the subclasses, such as "calculateGrade()" or "getCourseFee()". On the other hand, we can use an interface when:

 1. We want to define a contract for implementing classes, such as "Enrollable" or "Graded", that can be applied to different types of courses. 
 2. We want to achieve code flexibility and allow different classes, such as "OnlineCourse" or "In-PersonCourse", to implement multiple interfaces based on their specific characteristics. 
 3. We want to ensure that all implementing classes provide their own implementation for methods like "enrollStudent()" or "calculateFinalGrade()". To summarize, we use an abstract class when we want to provide a default implementation, define common attributes and behaviors, and enforce method implementation. We use an interface when we want to define a contract, achieve code flexibility, and allow multiple inheritance-like behavior. In our university system example, we can have an abstract class "Course" with default implementations and common attributes, and interfaces like "Enrollable" and "Graded" to define specific contracts for implementing classes.

 
 4. Discuss the concept of multiple inheritance in Java. How does the use of interfaces address the limitations of single inheritance, and what considerations should be kept in mind when implementing multiple interfaces?
 Ans : In Java, multiple inheritance refers to the ability of a class to inherit from multiple parent classes. However, Java does not support multiple inheritance of classes, meaning a class can only extend one parent class. This is to avoid the "diamond problem"
 
 where conflicts may arise if multiple parent classes have the same method or attribute. However, Java does support multiple inheritance of interfaces. This means that a class can implement multiple interfaces, allowing it to inherit behavior from all of them. By implementing multiple interfaces, a class can define its own implementation for each method defined in the interfaces. The use of interfaces addresses the limitations of single inheritance by allowing classes to inherit behavior from multiple sources. This promotes code reuse and modularity, as a class can implement different interfaces based on the specific behaviors it needs to exhibit. 
 
 When implementing multiple interfaces, there are a few considerations to keep in mind: 
 
 1. Method conflicts: If multiple interfaces define a method with the same signature, the implementing class must provide its own implementation for that method. This ensures that there are no conflicts in method resolution. 
 
 2. Interface compatibility: When implementing multiple interfaces, it's important to ensure that the interfaces are compatible and do not have conflicting requirements. Careful consideration should be given to the methods and behaviors defined in each interface to ensure they work together seamlessly. 
 
 3. Code organization: Implementing multiple interfaces can lead to a larger number of methods in a class. It's important to organize the code effectively and ensure that the class remains cohesive and follows good design principles. By considering these factors, we can effectively implement multiple interfaces and leverage the benefits of multiple inheritance-like behavior in Java.
